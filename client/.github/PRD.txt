1. Objective
Design and develop a web-based frontend application that allows users to:

Submit a URL via a modal form to a backend REST API.

Interact with an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT-like interface) to ask questions and view responses in a conversational UI.

2. Key Features
2.1 URL Submission Modal
Description:
A Call-to-Action (CTA) button on the main page that opens a modal for users to enter a URL and submit it to a backend REST API.

Requirements:

A prominently placed button labeled “Submit URL”.

Clicking the button opens a modal window.

Modal contains:

A single-line text input field for entering a URL.

A “Submit” button.

On submit:

Validate that the input is a valid URL.

Send a POST request using fetch to a REST API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/urls).

Handle and display success or error messages within the modal.

Out of Scope:

Backend endpoint implementation (assume it exists and accepts valid URLs).

2.2 ChatGPT-like LLM Interface
Description:
A conversational UI for users to input queries and get AI-generated responses displayed in a chat format.

Requirements:

A vertically scrollable chat window.

Each message (user or AI) shown as a message bubble with proper styling:

User messages right-aligned.

AI responses left-aligned.

An input field fixed at the bottom to type and submit queries.

On submitting a query:

Display user’s message in the chat.

Make a POST request to an LLM endpoint (e.g., POST /api/chat) with the query.

Display the response in the chat once received.

Show loading indicator while waiting for response.

Optional Enhancements (can be phased later):

Store and reload chat history.

Allow multi-turn context.
